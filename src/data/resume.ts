    "Software Engineer turned AI Engineer helping people understand AI through simple, visual explanations.",
  summary: `
  After completing my double degree in Computer Science and Information Technology, I spent time teaching, tutoring, and working as a TA. âœ¨ Thatâ€™s where I discovered two things I love: helping people learn & exploring the world of AI. I loved helping students understand complex ideas ðŸ’¡ and discovered that AI was the field where my curiosity and creativity truly came alive.
  
  
  I began my career as an intern at Dropbox but quickly realized that large corporate tech roles felt limiting and lacked the innovation I craved. That realization led me to join a smaller startup in the pharmaceutical space, where I found my calling. Today, Iâ€™m proud to contribute to the mission at the ACMA, helping shape the future of medical affairs through technology
